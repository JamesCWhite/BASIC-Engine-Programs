Please add 'smallshmup.bas' to the 'shmup' folder on your basic engine in order for this tutorial to access the assets it needs.

Lines:
20 sets up background 0 (you have 0-3 independent backgrounds to layer).  

50 loads spritesheet "charwalk.pcx" as sprite 0   (important) this is loading it into an offscreen buffer

 70 now actually defining sprite 0 size 32x32

80 putting sprite onto visible screen

90 turning sprite on

185 turning a window ON in background 0.  If you dont make a window area then the BE will not automatically erase sprite as it moved across screen

186 don't quite know why he moved the background down 8 pixels

830 moving sprite based on what happens when player presses movement buttons

770 tic is related to what section of the player sprite sheet we want to display to create "automatic" animation

1400 this is where tic in relation to "SPRITE 0 FRAME 0" makes the animation happen.  Maybe you can explain to me what the logical AND does in this statement?

Hope this helps some.
